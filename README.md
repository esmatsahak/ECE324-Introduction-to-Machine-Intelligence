# ECE324: Introduction to Machine Intelligence

## Description
This repository contains the labs and final project completed for the course ECE324. 

## Labs
This course consisted of five labs covering the following topics:

### Lab 1: Warmup 
Review of the following concepts: Notebooks, NumPy, Matplotlib, Image Representation

### Lab 2: Single-Neuron Classifier Coded from Scratch using PyTorch
Single-neuron classifier that solves the following problem: given a 3x3 array of binary data (containing only 1’s and 0’s), determine when the 3x3 pattern is
an ‘X’ as illustrated in Figure 1.

### Lab 3: Multi-Layer Perceptron for Binary Classification
Predicts whether a person is a high income earner or a low income earner based on the information supplied in the dataset (adult income dataset providing the annual income of about 48,000 American adults and consists of anonymous information such as occupation, age, native country, race, capital gain, capital loss, education, work class and more). A high income earner is defined to be someone who earns over $50,000 per year and a low income earner as someone who earns less than or equal to $50,000 per year.

### Lab 4: Classification of American Sign Language Images 
Convolutional neural network that predicts what letter hand sign language images convey. 

### Lab 5: Subjective/Objective Sentence Classification Using Word Vectors and NLP
Convolutional and recurrent neural networks that classify whether a sentence is subjective or objective taking in tokenized word embeddings as input. 

## Final Project
Course project completed in collaboration with two peers (Maxx Wu, Amy Xin). Pipeline converting audio data to mel spectrograms and passing to convolutional neural network to predict language. Audio data limited to English, Persian, and Mandarin.
